# Project Title

Building on Avalanche.

## Description

Building on Avalanche involves leveraging its high-throughput, low-latency, and customizable blockchain platform to develop decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and tokens. .


## Getting Started

You need an invitation to metacrafters to do this project.
### Executing program

* To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:



```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract DegenToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Degen", "DGN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** uint256(decimals()));
    }
}


```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
